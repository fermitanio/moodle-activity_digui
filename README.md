DIGUI FOR MOODLE
================ 

I've coded a new module for Moodle 2.6. I've upload the necessary files to https://github.com/fermitanio/moodle-activity_digui. The compressed file digui.rar, contains the complete structure of my module, including a readme file. As you may know, the file must be uncompressed into the mod directory of your Moodle distribution to be tested.

To see videos about Digui, go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nSKcknzSJQ. Please, contact with me by email for any question (fermitanio@hotmail.com). Thank you in advance and best regards. Fernando Martín.


QUICK INSTALL
=============

   Here is a basic outline of the installation process, which normally takes me 
   only a few minutes:

   1º The module is zipped in "Digui.rar" compressed file. Unzip the file and 
   move the entire structure (rooted at book) into the "moodle/mod/" directory.

   2º Log in Moodle as administrator.

   To uninstall the module, please follow next steps:

   1º Log in Moodle as administrator.

   2º Go to Settings > Site Administration > Plugins > Activities, and click the 
   Manage Activities link. 

   3º Find the module in the list of modules, and use the link in the delete 
   column.
   

   
WHAT DOES THIS ACTIVITY DO
==========================

   Many times, the teacher provides to students text pages, and the student has 
   to read it. However, most of the time students won't want to read the entire 
   document, but just sections of it. Digui comes with a digital highlighter 
   pen that lets you mark up and colorize the text in your document. With digui 
   activity, you can highlight your texts, and save the results on a file. Use 
   the Highlight tool to mark and find important text on a webpage, just like 
   you'd on paper. Also, you can make your own notes with Digui. Digui gives you
   margin space available for writing. You may decide to emphasise:

    * a sentence or word that sums up an important idea,
    * quotations,
    * statistics,
    * specialised terms,
    * important or useful data,
    * examples or links to other ideas.
	   
   Using highlighters to mark key texts is a great idea. Highlighting is 
   convenient when graphs and charts from the text are important to 
   understanding the material. Highlighting helps you when to think critically 
   and formulate your own response to the text. Also, highlighting can improve 
   retention of selected text material, because it draws attention to individual 
   facts. 
   
   
	
HIGHLIGHTING TECHNIQUES
=======================

a. Highlighting blocks of text

   When the mouse pointer turns into an marker pen, do the following:

   1. Click at the start of the block of text you want to highlight. 
   2. Hold down the Shift key on your keyboard (The Shift keys are the ones 
   with the block arrows on them, pointing upwards).
   3. With the Shift key held down, click your left mouse button at the end of 
   the block of text you want to highlight.
   4. A block of text will be highlighted

b. Highlight by dragging

   When the mouse pointer turns into an marker pen, do the following:
 
   1. Click with your left mouse button at the start of the text you want to 
   highlight. 
   2. Keep your left mouse button held down.
   3. Drag your mouse pointer across the screen.
   4. When you've reached the end of the text you want to highlight, let go of 
   the mouse button.
   5. Your text is highlighted.

c. Highlighting a single word

   When the mouse pointer turns into an marker pen, do the following:

   1. Double click on the word with your left mouse button. 	
   2. A single word will be highlighted.

d. Remove highlighting from a document 

   Press "Erase all" button to remove highlighting from a text page of the
   document.


   
USER MANUAL
===========

Before you can highlight, you must upload the file that contain the text. This file is unique, and must be a text plain file (.txt) or a web page (.html). After this process, Digui extracts the text and ignore images and other elements of the file. 

From this moment, the user can select and highlight the text. To do this, the user must open the Edit section and begin to drag the mouse over the screen. 

Same text can be highlighted multiple times by different users. In this case, the text color appears gray, darker more users have highlighted the text.

To view the results, the user can open the View Section. 

To export the selected text to a file, the user use the Export section. 

Only teachers can evaluate the rest of users, through the Grade section. However, after a teacher have evaluated all users, the students can view their grades through the Grade section.

Thank you for using Digui!
